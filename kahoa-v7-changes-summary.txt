ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED:
======================
Missing scroll-margin-top CSS property caused inconsistent scroll behavior.
- Camp 1 worked because it was first (no camps above it)
- Camps 2-8 failed because cumulative margins created offset issues

THE FIX:
========
Added scroll-margin-top: 20px to ALL camps ensures consistent 20px offset
from viewport top when scrollIntoView() is called.

TESTING:
========
Open /Users/jamesbrady/kahoa-roadmap-phase1-fixed-v7-scroll.html
Click waypoints 1-8 and verify:
  ✓ All camps scroll to 20px from viewport top
  ✓ Console shows "Distance from top: 20" for all camps
  ✓ Behavior is identical across all 8 camps

NEXT STEPS:
===========
1. Test in browser
2. Verify console logs show consistent behavior
3. Remove console.log statements if desired (optional)
4. Deploy to production
